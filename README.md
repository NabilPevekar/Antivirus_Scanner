# Antivirus_Scanner
GuardianShield is an open-source antivirus project designed to provide robust protection against a wide range of computer viruses and malware.

## Overview

ðŸš€ In this project, I've developed a basic GUI Antivirus program using Python and Tkinter. This project provides a hands-on experience in GUI development and introduces fundamental concepts in cybersecurity.

## Features

1. **Live Scanning:** See files being scanned in real-time.
2. **Progress Bar:** Track scanning progress from 0% to 100%.
3. **Scan Results:** Clear indications of whether a file is safe or potentially infected.

## How to Use
